# Exercise 1: Resources and URIs

API-X supports a [proxy mode](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/fcrepo-api-x/blob/master/src/site/markdown/uris-in-apix.md#api-x-intercepting-uris) that is used to support the [intercepting](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/fcrepo-api-x/blob/master/src/site/markdown/execution-and-routing.md#intercepting-modality) extension modality, and link to a [service document](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/fcrepo-api-x/blob/master/src/site/markdown/service-discovery-and-binding.md#service-document) for each resource which itself links to all services exposed on the object by API-X.  This exercise will explore the out-of-the-box of API-X proxy mode.  We'll call links directly to Fedora *direct* links, and links via the API-X proxy *proxied*.  Typically, the *proxied* URIs are made public (and shared/linked by others on the internet at large), whereas the *direct* URIs are used by internal infrastructure for specific purposes.

## A. Look at a Fedora object 

Look at a fedora object via direct and proxy URIs in order to compare and contrast representations

1. Point your browser to the *proxied* fedora root object:  <code>http://**localhost**/fcrepo/rest</code> 
    
2. Look at the list of children.  Note that their URIs all begin with the *proxied* base URI
    
3. Follow the link to the extensions child: <code>http://**localhost**/fcrepo/rest/apix/extensions</code>.  This is the API-X extension registry container.  You'll see that it already contains some extensions in it; we'll talk about these in another exercise.  Just like the root resource, all URIs are *proxy* URIs
    

4. Now look at the extensions resource at the command line via curl.  Let's look at a HEAD request:
    <pre>
    curl -I http://<b>localhost</b>/fcrepo/rest/apix/extensions
    </pre>
    
5. Look for a link header with relation "service", as in `Link: <http://localhost/discovery/apix/extensions>; rel="service"`.  API-X adds this link, which resolves to a [service document](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/fcrepo-api-x/blob/master/src/site/markdown/service-discovery-and-binding.md#service-document) for the object.  Other exercises will explore the contents of service documents; right now we're mostly interested in the mechanics of retrieving headers and links.

6. Now perform the same HEAD request against the direct link to fedora.  Simply add the port 8080 to the URI: 
    <pre>
    curl -I http://<b>localhost</b>:8080/fcrepo/rest/apix/extensions
    </pre>
  - Notice that there is no longer a "service" link relation; but everything else is the same

7. Now view the direct link in the browser.  It's the same as in step 3, except for the URIs.  All URIs are also direct links.

## B. Look at proxied binary resources.  
Binary resources in Fedora are a little more complicated than plain RDF objects.

1. Navigate to the root proxy URI in your browser <code>http://**localhost**/fcrepo/rest</code>

2. Create a container named _images_
   * If using the the UI, in _Create New Child Resource_ type `images` into the _identifier_ text box, and make sure `container` is selected from the `type` dropdown menu.  If no such controls are visible, click the red _Toggle actions_ button.
  * If using the command line, do 
    <pre>
    curl -X POST -H "Slug: images" http://<b>localhost</b>/fcrepo/rest
    </pre>

3. Upload a binary image to the _images_ container, and give it a reasonable name.  
  * If using the UI, in _Create New Child Resource_, select Type: _binary_, Identifier: _filename.jpg_ (or whatever you wish to call it).  When you select _binary_, you'll be prompted to upload an image from your local machine.  Choose an arbitrary image, or download one from the internet to use.  Feel free to do a Google Image Search for "cows".
  * If using the command line, for a file named `filename.jpg` in your current directory, do
  <pre>
  curl -i -X POST --data-binary "@filename.jpg" -H "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"filename.jpg\"" http://<b>localhost</b>/fcrepo/rest/images
  </pre>

4. When you upload a binary from the UI, you will be redirected to the binary's _metadata_ resource.  Via the command line, you will be returned a `Location` header which points to the newly created binary resource itself.  Currently in Fedora, the URIs of a binary and its properties/metadata are distinct. Let's explore the metadata resource first.  Its URI will be something like: <code>http://**localhost**/fcrepo/rest/images/filename.jpg/fcr:metadata</code>.  Look at its headers using:
    <pre>
    curl -I http://<b>localhost</b>/fcrepo/rest/images/filename.jpg/fcr:metadata
    </pre>
You should see a link to a service document.  This is a service document for the _metadata_ of the binary resource.  The service document for the binary resource itself can be found by exploring its headers.  Before doing that, realize that you shouldn't try to construct a metadata URI given a binary resource URI or vice versa based on _a priori_ knowledge of how a particular Fedora implementation constructs its URIs.  Instead, look for `rel=describes` or `rel=describedby` headers, and follow those links.  When retrieving the headers for the metadata resource above, you should have seen a `rel=describes` link which points to the binary it describes.  Do a HEAD request on it
    <pre>
    curl -I http://<b>localhost</b>/fcrepo/rest/images/filename.jpg
    </pre>
It too has a link to a service document; one that enumerates all services that can operate on that binary resource.
